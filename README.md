# About the [Matlab](http://www.mathworks.com) and [Octave](https://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) binding for Tango

This is the Matlab (or Octave) client API for [Tango](http://tango-controls.org). 
It runs on both Linux and Windows x64. 
So far, the x86 (i.e. 32 bits) mode is still supported on Linux but might be abandoned in a near future.  
However, here 'abandoned' simply means not tested under x86. The code will certainly continue to compile and run smoothly in x86 mode.

# Important Note
In any release <= 3.0.0, the Tango DevBoolean type used to be mapped to Matlab unint8. Since release 3.1.0, itâ€™s now mapped to Matlab logical type. It means that any existing code must be adapted to become compatible with the new DevBoolean mapping:

```
argin = unint8(1) -- becomes --> argin = true
argin = unint8(0) -- becomes --> argin = false
```

Another solution is to recompile the binding with `MAP_DEV_BOOLEAN_TO_MATLAB_LOGICAL` undefined in order to retrieve the initial behavior. 

# Documentation

Each TANGO m-function is self-documented (online documentation). 
Use the Matlab <help> function to get information on a particular TANGO m-function (e.g. help tango_read_attribute). 

# How to build on Windows using Microsoft Visual C++ 
- software requirements 
  * Microsoft Visual C++ >= 2013 (a.k.a msvc12) 
  * Matlab x64 >= 2009  
  * No octave support on Windows (unless you're ready to recompile Tango with cygwin)

- clone the github repository in a directory of your choice (here we use c:\github)
```
cd c:\github 
git clone git@github.com:tango-controls/matlab-binding.git
```

- edit the `compil-env-setup.bat` file
```
{edit} c:\github\matlab-binding\windows\msvcxx\compil-env-setup.bat
```

- set BINDING_PATH to the matlab-binding clone location  
```
set BINDING_PATH=c:\github\matlab-binding 
```

- set ML_ROOT64 according to your local Matlab installation
```
set ML_ROOT64=C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2016b
```

- save the `compil-env-setup.bat` file then open the Visual C++ project
```
{double-click-on} c:\github\matlab-binding\windows\msvcxx\run-me-to-compile.bat
```

- select the configuration you want to compile then build the solution
```
{select one of the following combination} [release or debug] / [x64]
{build}
```

- the compilation will hopefully succeed
```
{safely ignore} warning LNK4088: image being generated due to /FORCE option; image may not run
{check for presence of} c:\github\matlab-binding\mex-file\tango_binding.mexw64
```
- in case you want to use your own Tango runtime, just edit the `compil-env-setup.bat`, modify the paths then rebuild the solution

# How to build on Linux using gcc 
The main constraint we have is to compile the binding with a gcc version producing a shared library which is binary compatible with the Matlab/Octave version we plan to use. It means we have to identify the proper gcc version to use before trying to compile the code. Fortunately, the Matworks website contains [a page providing this critical information](https://fr.mathworks.com/support/sysreq/previous_releases.html). 

Here is the compilation process...
 
- clone the github repository in a directory of your choice (here we use $HOME/github)
```
cd $HOME/github
git clone git@github.com:tango-controls/matlab-binding.git
```

- optionally, recompile the whole Tango software chain with the appropriate gcc version
  * see [cppTango](https://github.com/tango-controls/cppTango) for details
  * using your own Tango runtime requires `$HOME/github/matlab-binding/src/Makefile.[octave].linux` to be adapted 
  * `$HOME/github/matlab-binding/src/Makefile.[octave].linux` is also the place where the gcc version to be used is specified
  
- compile the binding 
```
cd $HOME/github/matlab-binding/src
make -f Makefile.linux or make -f Makefile.octave.linux
```

- the compilation will hopefully succeed
```
{check for presence of} $HOME/github/matlab-binding/mex-file/tango_binding.mexglx
```
